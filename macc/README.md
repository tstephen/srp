=== Marginal Abatement Cost Curve === 

This project contains a couple of related (working) prototypes at the moment: 
* A d3.js html page that presents example MAC curves based on hard-coded sample  data (from the SDU paper). 
* A UML sketch of what an invoice portal based on Spring Roo might look like. 
* A couple of Java classes aimed at supporting pro-rata annualisation of invoices.
