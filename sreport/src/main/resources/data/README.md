# Where this data comes from

## ERIC data

ERIC data is published at http://hefs.hscic.gov.uk/. These files are the 
combined Trust, Site and PFI data in Excel format and then have the Trust level 
data extracted and saved as a CSV file in the form ERIC-yyyy-yy.csv. Note that 
the expected delimiter is dollar ($) not comma (,)
